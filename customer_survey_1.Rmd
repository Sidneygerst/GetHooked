This markdown will combine the two customer surveys and compare existing customer answers with new customer answers. 

```{r}

#load in the customer data
new_customers <- read_csv("new_customer_survey1.csv")
old_customers <- read_csv("existing_customer_survey1.csv")

#add new identifer column to both dataframes before combining
new_customer_id <- new_customers %>%
  mutate(id = "new")

old_customer_id <- old_customers %>%
  mutate(id = "existing") %>%
  select(-X46)

#combine the dfs
all_customers <- bind_rows(new_customer_id, old_customer_id) %>%
  select(-feedback, -name) #get rid of columns w NAs (feedback and names), we don't care

```
