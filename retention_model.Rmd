### Market analysis to determine which variables influence the decision to continue, maybe continue, or not continue with Get Hooked subscription post COVID-19 SIP


*Ordinal logistic regression to predict the probability of staying with Get Hooked after COVID-19 based on delivery count, age, necessity, income, id

```{r}

#Set-Up

#Ordering the dependent variable
customer_subset$covid_end = factor(customer_subset$covid_end, levels = c("Unlikely to continue", "Not sure", "Likely to continue"), ordered = TRUE) 

#Ordering the independent variables
customer_subset$age = factor(customer_subset$age, levels = c("18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65+"), ordered = TRUE)
customer_subset$delivery_count = factor(customer_subset$delivery_count, levels = c("1-3", "4-6", "7-9", "10 or more"), ordered = TRUE)
customer_subset$necessary_grocery = factor(customer_subset$necessary_grocery, levels = c("No, it is extra", "Sometimes", "Yes"), ordered = TRUE)
customer_subset$income = factor(customer_subset$income, levels = c("< $50K", "$50 - $100K", "$101 - $150K", "$151 - $200K", "$201 - $250K","Over $250K"), ordered = TRUE)

```

```{r}

#Data Exploration


#Summarizing the data
summary(customer_subset)

#Making frequency table
table(customer_subset$covid_end, customer_subset$delivery_count) # more deliveries more likely to continue
table(customer_subset$covid_end, customer_subset$age) # likely to continue peaks at 25-45 age range
table(customer_subset$covid_end, customer_subset$necessary_grocery) # seen as a ncessity, more likley to continue
table(customer_subset$covid_end, customer_subset$income) # likely to continue peaks at $101-150K  
table(customer_subset$covid_end, customer_subset$id) # existing customers more likely to continue, new customers are more unsure

```
